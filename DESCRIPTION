Description: Simulates from discrete and continuous target distributions 
        using geometric Metropolis-Hastings (MH) 
        algorithms decribed in Roy (2014). Users specify the target distribution 
        by an R function that evaluates the log un-normalized pdf or pmf. The package 
        also contains a function implementing a specific geometric MH algorithm for 
        performing high dimensional Bayesian variable selection.
